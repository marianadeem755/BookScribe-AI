- **Chapter Summaries**: Automatically generate chapter wise summaries in learning style.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions about the document and get AI generated answers with relevant context.
- **Learning Style Customization**: Choose from different learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic) for personalized summaries.
- **Groq LLM Integration**: Use Groq's powerful language models for summarization and Q&A.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: Create vector stores for efficient document search and retrieval.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
